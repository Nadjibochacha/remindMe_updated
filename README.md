💡 Why It Matters
Most people forget 70% of what they learn within 24 hours. RemindMe uses a "proactive exposure" strategy. By pushing your specific word collections to your notification tray at intervals you choose, the app keeps the information "fresh" in your working memory until it moves into long-term storage.


📘 User Manual: How RemindMe Works
The core philosophy of RemindMe is Proactive Exposure. Instead of waiting for you to open the app, the app brings the knowledge to you.

Step 1: Create a Collection
Purpose: Group related words together (e.g., "Medical Terms," "French Verbs").

Action: Tap the + icon, name your collection, and choose a color-coded theme.

Step 2: Add Your Content
Input: Type in the word/phrase and its definition or translation.

Storage: Your data is saved instantly to our ObjectBox high-speed local database.

Step 3: Set the "Nudge" Frequency
Customization: Go to the collection settings and choose your interval (e.g., every 1 hour).

The Magic: The app's background scheduler picks a random word from your active collection and pushes it to your notification tray.

Step 4: Passive Learning
Engagement: Every time you check your phone for a text or the time, you’ll see a word. This "micro-exposure" builds long-term memory without requiring dedicated study sessions.
